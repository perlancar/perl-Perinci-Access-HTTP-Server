         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Web server portion refactored out into separate distribution (Gepok).
           Now PSGI-based and more modular (e.g. authentication/authorization
           separated as middleware). Some commands not yet implemented (help,
           spec, etc). No tests yet.
